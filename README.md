## How to connect your GraphQL Backend URL ?

For the demo purpose we had a very simple Code First GraphQL api in /api/graphql and /lib as very simple full stack approach. 

Of course depending of the project you might delete that and connect instead your graphql back-end instead.

See the /pages/_app.tsx to change that or use [Up React](https://github.com/uptoolkit/up-react) to handle that.
